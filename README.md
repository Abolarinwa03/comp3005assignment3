This application is used to perform simple CRUD (CREATE, REPLACE , UPDATE and DELETE) functions. I have chosen to use IntelliJ.
HOW TO RUN MY CODE:
To see the effect of each function comment out the each on except getAllStudents() and copy and paste getAllStudents() under the function.
For example to see the effect of deleteStudent do this:   
//addStudent(...)
//updateStudent(...)
deleteStudent(...)
getAllStudents(...)
Here is a link demonstrating how the application works and how it affects the database: https://vimeo.com/924840861?share=copy
